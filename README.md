# <JavaScript Quiz>

## Description


For this project, I was tasked with creating a javascript quiz that had a timer attached and tracked scores. This project was useful in showing how html and css elements can be changed and added through Javascript. It was also useful in showing how local storage on a browser can hold data and continue to show that data.  

## Installation

To install the Javascript Quiz, I used the given html and css documents to create a javascript document that would add the needed functionality to the page. I then created a github repository, cloned that repository to my local device, copied the code files to the repository, pushed the files to the repository on github, and then enabled pages on github to create a live link. 

## Usage


## Credits

I recieved help on this project from my instructors, Henery Winget and Chris Sinlasath.
